 * spillable. This behaves like an Iterator but is not an Iterator because this cannot be used
 * in place of an Iterator, especially in the context of an RDD where it would violate the
 * semantics of the GpuSemaphore. Generally the lifetime of this should be entirely while the
 * GpuSemaphore is held. It is "generally" because there are a few cases where for performance
 * reasons if we know that no data is going to be produced, then we might not grab the semaphore
 * at all.
